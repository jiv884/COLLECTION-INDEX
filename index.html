  <h4>This is a map of my journey from 2017 to 2019.</h4>
  <h4>I selected 45 photos from the time period that express 3 different status of my "loneliness": </h4>
  <h4><i>WHEN I'M NOT ALONE - </i>Pictures I took when I was by myself; pure solitude.</h4>
  <h4><i>WHEN I'M NOT ALONE - </i>Pictures I took with people; companionship.</h4>
  <h4><i>WHEN I FEEL I'M NOT ALONE - </i>Pictures of films, books or artworks that kept me company when I was alone.</h4>
  <h4>I depicted this map with these moments that recorded my loneliness.</h4>
